## Outline

1. Genomic Surveillance
    1. Defining genomic surveillance, and its purpose.
    1. Hardware:
    1. Software:
        1. Databases
        1. Phylogenetic Modelling
1. Phenotypic Surveillance
    1. Defining phenotypic surveillance:
        1. Beyond drug susceptibility testing: determining biochemical properties of a virus' set of proteins.
    1. Most common use case: antibiotic drug resistance determination. (#citation required)
1. Case studies: where has genomic surveillance been used? 
    1. Ebola outbreak of 2014/2015
    1. Zika outbreak of 2015/2016
    1. Salmonella outbreak, Birmingham
    1. Seasonal influenza
1. What's missing:
    1. The "real-time" factor for determining phenotype. How close (in time) from sampling can we gain insights, and not just sequence?
    1. Moving beyond evolutionary histories to phenotypic trajectories. (Not saying evo history is useless; just saying we need more.) Can we better forecast the growth of drug resistance?
1. A plan forward:
    1. Systematically characterized data set.
        1. Cover the viable genotype space: use what's been isolated (those have been successful in nature).
    1. How machine learning can help.
        1. Map mutational trajectories. (MDS plots), help guide generation of new mutants.
        1. Supervised learning - learn mapping from genotype space to phenotype space.
