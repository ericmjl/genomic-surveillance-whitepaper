# Real-Time Genomic Surveillance

## Abstract

This whitepaper proposes an implementation on how real-time genomic surveillance can be accomplished.

## Outline

1. Genomic Surveillance for Viral Infectious Agents
    1. Defining genomic surveillance
    2. Available technologies:
        3.  Portable sequencers
        4.  High throughput, high read depth sequencers.
    5. 
1. Phenotypic Surveillance for Viral Infectious Agents
    2. Defining phenotypic surveillance:
        3. Beyond drug susceptibility testing: determining biochemical properties of a virus' set of proteins.
    4. Most common use case: 
2. Case studies: where has genomic surveillance been used? 
    3. Ebola outbreak of 2014/2015
    4. Zika outbreak of 2015/2016
    5. Seasonal influenza
1. What's missing:
1. A plan forward:
    2. Systematically characterized data set.
        3. Cover the viable genotype space: use what's been isolated (those have been successful in nature).
    1. How machine learning can help.
        2. Map mutational trajectories. (MDS plots), help guide generation of new mutants.
        3. Supervised learning - learn mapping from genotype space to phenotype space.
