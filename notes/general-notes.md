- WOW, this editorial essay is a really good one.
- editorial essay on molecular and genomic epidemiology
- Whole genome sequencing is the main thing that they highlight at the end.
- authors claim that WGS has two key advantages:
  - provides maximal strain discrimination (oh yeah!)
  - can be linked to "clinically and epidemiologically relevant phenotypes"
- Challenges for WGS include:
  - speed
  - data analysis
  - interpretation: given the fast evolutionary processes that occur, the key challenge here will be the interpretation of amino acid polymorphisms and their effect on these clinically and epidemiologically relevant phenotypes
  - cost
- Author brings up the concept of a **"resistome"** (the set of genes involved in antimicrobial resistance) and the **"virulome"** (the set of genes linked to the virulence of an isolate).

- a cool website that I think should be explored a bit.
